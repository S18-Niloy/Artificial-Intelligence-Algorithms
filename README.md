# AI Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms, primarily focused on search techniques, optimization methods, and problem-solving strategies in Python. These algorithms are suitable for educational purposes, reference, or integration into larger projects.


## Algorithms Included

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) & Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Classic graph traversal algorithms.
2. **Maximum Region & Alien Affected Area**: A custom problem-solving algorithm.
3. **A* Search Algorithm**: A heuristic-based search algorithm for finding the shortest path.
4. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes decision-making in minimax-based AI systems.
5. **Genetic Algorithm (8-Queens)**: Solves the 8-Queens problem using genetic algorithms.
6. **Bidirectional Search**: Efficiently finds the shortest path by searching from both the source and destination.
